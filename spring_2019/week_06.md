## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Well the activate method failed because I learned that I have to
> write my own test cases. I guess my accomplishment is that I know 
> what I need to do next to hopefully finish the activate method.

## This Week's Plan

> Write some test cases and hopefully have the activate method working. 

## Anything Blocking?

> I don't know how to write test cases, but luckily someone else on the team 
> does so it's okay!
