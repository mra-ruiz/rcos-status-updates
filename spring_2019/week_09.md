## Last Week's Accomplishments

> The encoder is fully working! I not only got it to functionally work 
> but I made sure the rendering was correct.

## This Week's Plan

> work on the decoder and the rendering for the decoder. 

## Anything Blocking?

> the original encoder did not have an enable input and it kind of needs
> it. I am trying to add it but it changes the functionality of the code 
> that I finally got to work. Oh well, that's what programming is all about.
