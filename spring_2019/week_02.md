## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I finally understood how the project structure works. It seems silly but
> I would even struggle just to find the file that I was assigned to work on.

## This Week's Plan

> My goal for next week is just to understand the layout of the whole project. 

## Anything Blocking?

> I have never worked on an opened sourced project before so I'm very intimidated
> by all there is to do. I also have very little git experience so even just updating
> my local version of the project is a struggle. I thought it would be easier to jump in
> specially since i'm in Psoft right now and i'm learning how to refactor and write
> code specs. However it's been a huge struggle just to understand how all the files 
> are connected. I know I can easily see which classes extend which ones but it felt
> like for a small method, there was a function that came from an extended class, and that
> class was extended from yet another class, and so on. So just to even understand one
> method I had to look at like 5 different files. This has made it extremely difficult to 
> even start working on the Encoder and Decoder classes. Definitely have to keep my goals
> and weekly plans a little more achievable and humbler lol.

## Notes

> There's so much to learn about git it's crazy! I'm glad I went to the bonus session but
> I'm still lost :(
