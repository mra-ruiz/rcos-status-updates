## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week I learned about typescript and refreshed my knowledge in
>JavaScript by doing some documentation and debugging a little.
>I went to an rcos bonus class where I learned about
>and refreshed myself on git commands git this was very useful
>because I need a refresher on the basics of forking
>and committing. Also the little tutorial was very useful
>to practice some of the things I was a little rusty on.
>I start to work on an Encoder and Decoder class for my project OpenCircuits.

## This Week's Plan

>My goal is to try to finish the Encoder class and have it full debugged.
>Currently it is not finished or debugged. I also want to begin work
>on the decoder class.

## Anything Blocking?

>It was difficult to adapt to familiarize with the code
>and understand where and what every function did. I was also
>difficult to code in typescript because even though
>I have worked with JavaScript before it was a while ago so I was very rusty
>and I there are certain key differences that make it
>confusing convert from JavaScript to typescript. Thankfully Leon
>our team leader has been quite helpful with that.
>I also had a late start to the class due to a scheduling conflict
>which made it a little difficult to jump in at the beginning
>but it is much better now.
