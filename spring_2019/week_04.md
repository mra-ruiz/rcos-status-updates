## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I started planning out the activate method for the Encoder class. 

## This Week's Plan

> My plan is to  try to understand how the activate method should work
> for the encoder. I'm trying to make sure it works for all kinds of encoders. 

## Anything Blocking?

> I am looking at the activate method for other components and they are a little
> confusing. I also don't really understand the differences between typescript
> and javascript.
