## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I have the rendering for the decoder done! I also have been working 
> on the rendering of gates, latches, and other components because there
> is a strange bug in them. 

## This Week's Plan

> Finish implementing the enable input on the decoder and on the 
> encoder. I also need to finish the main function of the decoder. 
> If time permits, I would also like to work on the rendering of all the
> other components. 

## Anything Blocking?

> the lack of the enable input in the original encoder and decoders.
