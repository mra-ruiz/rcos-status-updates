## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I was officially assigned a task last week and I recently learned how to see what 
> is assigned to me on GitHub. I learned how read about other git issues as well. 
> Not too confident in using GitHub yet but I feel a little better about it. 

## This Week's Plan

> Understand what the new encoder code needs to do. Look at other code for other components
> to see what they do. 

## Anything Blocking?

> I don't really know how encoders work. Also, since I'm looking at other files, like the 
> D-latch, I have to understand the methods of that file and it's taking forever.
